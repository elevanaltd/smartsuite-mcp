feat: implement QueryHandler for QUERY-001 contract (GREEN state)

Components implemented:
- QueryHandler class with list/get/search/count operations
- Minimal implementation following SmartSuite client delegation pattern
- Mock-based unit tests with full coverage of contract requirements

Architecture:
- QueryHandler â†’ SmartSuiteClient â†’ SmartSuite API (delegation pattern)
- Dependency injection via setClient() for testability
- Operation routing based on context.operation parameter

Test Results: 7/7 passing (GREEN state achieved)
- List records with pagination
- Get single record by ID
- Search with filters
- Count records
- Error handling for invalid table IDs

Quality Gates: âœ“ lint âœ“ typecheck âœ“ test

Contract: QUERY-001 (List records by table ID)
Phase: RED â†’ GREEN (minimal code to pass tests)
Next: REFACTOR phase for code optimization
