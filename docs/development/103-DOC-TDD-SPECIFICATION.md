## Required Failing Tests (TDD RED State)

### 1. SmartSuite Client CRUD Operations (11 tests needed)

**File**: `test/smartsuite-client.test.ts` (extend existing)

#### listRecords Operation (4 tests)
- ✅ Should list records with no options
- ✅ Should handle pagination (limit, offset)
- ✅ Should handle sorting (multiple fields, directions)  
- ✅ Should handle filtering (complex filter objects)

#### getRecord Operation (2 tests)  
- ✅ Should get specific record by ID
- ✅ Should handle record not found (404)

#### createRecord Operation (2 tests)
- ✅ Should create new record with data
- ✅ Should handle validation errors (400)

#### updateRecord Operation (2 tests)
- ✅ Should update existing record
- ✅ Should handle record not found on update

#### deleteRecord Operation (2 tests) 
- ✅ Should delete existing record
- ✅ Should handle record not found on delete

#### getSchema Operation (2 tests)
- ✅ Should get application schema structure  
- ✅ Should handle application not found

### 2. SmartSuite Error Handling (8 tests needed)

**File**: `test/smartsuite-error-handling.test.ts` (new file)

#### API Error Scenarios (8 tests)
- ⏳ Rate limiting (429) with retry guidance
- ⏳ Service unavailable (503) with helpful message  
- ⏳ Forbidden access (403) to workspace
- ⏳ Malformed JSON in error responses
- ⏳ Custom base URL support validation
- ⏳ Network timeout handling with recovery guidance
- ⏳ Large response handling (pagination required)
- ⏳ Concurrent request throttling

### 3. MCP Server Tool Operations (15 tests needed)

**File**: `test/mcp-server-tools.test.ts` (new file)

#### Query Tool Tests (4 tests)
- ⏳ Execute list operation with parameters
- ⏳ Execute get operation for specific record
- ⏳ Execute search operation with filters
- ⏳ Execute count operation 

#### Record Tool Tests (5 tests)
- ⏳ Execute create with dry-run (default true)
- ⏳ Execute create with dry-run false (real creation)
- ⏳ Execute update operation
- ⏳ Execute delete operation  
- ⏳ Execute bulk operations (bulk_update, bulk_delete)

#### Schema Tool Tests (2 tests)
- ⏳ Get application schema structure
- ⏳ Handle invalid application ID

#### Undo Tool Tests (2 tests)  
- ⏳ Undo operation with operation_id
- ⏳ Handle invalid operation_id

#### Tool Validation Tests (2 tests)
- ⏳ Handle unknown tool names
- ⏳ Validate required parameters

### 4. MCP Server Integration (6 tests needed)

**File**: `test/mcp-server-integration.test.ts` (new file)

#### Authentication Integration (3 tests)
- ⏳ Require authentication before tool execution
- ⏳ Successfully authenticate with SmartSuite client
- ⏳ Handle authentication failures properly

#### Tool Execution Flow (3 tests)
- ⏳ Full flow: authenticate → execute query → return results
- ⏳ Error propagation from SmartSuite client to MCP tools  
- ⏳ State management across multiple tool executions

### 5. Configuration and Edge Cases (7 tests needed)

**File**: `test/configuration-edge-cases.test.ts` (new file)

#### Configuration Tests (4 tests)
- ⏳ Load configuration from environment variables
- ⏳ Handle missing required configuration
- ⏳ Validate configuration format
- ⏳ Handle configuration file loading

#### Edge Case Tests (3 tests)
- ⏳ Handle extremely large record payloads
- ⏳ Handle special characters in field values
- ⏳ Handle concurrent client instances

## Test Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Extend Existing Tests (Safe)
1. Extend `test/smartsuite-client.test.ts` with CRUD operation tests
2. Add comprehensive error scenarios to existing test files

### Phase 2: New Test Files (Requires Approval)
1. Create focused test files for specific concerns
2. Ensure proper consultation evidence and approval tokens
3. Follow existing test patterns and naming conventions

### Phase 3: Integration Tests
1. Test MCP server tool execution
2. Test SmartSuite client integration
3. Test end-to-end workflows

## Expected Failures (RED State Validation)

All new tests should FAIL initially because:

1. **MCP Server**: Only has stub `getTools()` method, no `executeTool()` method
2. **SmartSuite Client**: CRUD methods exist but need proper parameter handling
3. **Error Handling**: Basic error handling exists but not comprehensive
4. **Integration**: No authentication integration between MCP server and client

## Success Criteria (GREEN State Goals)

- ✅ All 47+ tests passing (17 current + 30+ new)
- ✅ 80%+ code coverage across all source files
- ✅ Proper error handling for all API scenarios
- ✅ Full MCP server tool functionality
- ✅ Complete SmartSuite client CRUD operations
- ✅ Robust integration between components

## TESTGUARD Compliance

- ✅ RED → GREEN → REFACTOR cycle followed
- ✅ Failing tests written BEFORE implementation
- ✅ Tests validate behavior, not implementation details
- ✅ Proper mocking of external dependencies (fetch API)
- ✅ Test isolation and cleanup (beforeEach patterns)

## Security Considerations

- ✅ No hardcoded API keys in tests
- ✅ Proper error message handling (no sensitive data leakage)
- ✅ Input validation testing for all user-provided data
- ✅ Authentication flow testing with invalid credentials

**Next Steps**: 
1. Implement failing tests following this specification
2. Verify all tests fail (RED state)
3. Implement functionality to make tests pass (GREEN state)
4. Refactor while maintaining test coverage
